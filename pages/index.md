# Welcome to Evidence! ðŸ‘‹
Evidence enables analysts to deliver a polished business intelligence system using SQL & markdown.

# Write Markdown
Evidence pages are just markdown files. The file for this page is `pages/index.md`.

ðŸ‘‰ Add some text below and save the file to see it update instantly.

# Connect to a Database
ðŸ‘‰ Connect to a database in the **Settings** menu. For this tutorial, choose a **SQLite** database and enter the filename `needful_things`. [Settings &rarr;](/settings)

# Run SQL
Write queries using markdown code fences ` ``` `:

![sql-code](sql.svg)


```orders_by_month
select
  substr(order_datetime,1,7) as date,
  sum(sales) as sales_usd0k
from orders

group by date
```

You can see both the SQL and the query results by interacting with the query above.

ðŸ‘‰ Edit the above query to just display 2021 data by adding:

`where order_datetime >= '2021-01-01'`

# Add Charts & Components
Charts can be included in a single line of code:

![barchart-code](BarChart.svg)

<BarChart data = {orders_by_month} title = 'Sales by Month, USD'/>

ðŸ‘‰ Change the chart to a `LineChart`.

# Use More Powerful Features âš¡
Evidence supports using logic & loops to determine what text and data is displayed.
